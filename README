Welcome to the unofficial zfs-crypto branch.

To make it clear, this branch has nothing to do with Sun, Oracle,
ZFSOnLinux, OpenSolaris, IllumOS, OpenIndiana, SmartOS, FreeBSD etc.

There are new files,

zcrypt.c
zcrypt.h
zio_crypt.c
zio_crypt.h
dsl_crypto.c
dsl_crypto.h
libzfs_crypto.c
zcrypt_common.c

which are kept "as is" as much as possible, including (possibly
irrelevant) headers.

The crypto/api/ header files are from OpenSolaris.

The crypto/api implementation is brand new, and supports "bare
minimum" features as needed by ZFS only.

All ciphers (CCM, GCM, CTR) are currently working, and compatible with
the Linux ZOL implementation.


* Key needs to be CK_AES prepared, better than current

* All "// FIXME" should be inspected. In particular, known areas
  which differ are PROP_ALIAS, PROP_INHERIT, crypto vs userquota,

* Removed KEY methods "https URI" (requires curl) and pkcs11 types.

* The pool version is now 5000, and added feature flag
  "feature@encryption".

* feature@encryption goes active if any ZFS are created with encryption=on.

* Allow for readonly import of active feature@encryption, so that the non-
  encrypted filesystems could be recovered.

Example:
```

# zfs create -o encryption=aes-256-gcm mypool/BOOM
  Enter passphrase for 'mypool/BOOM':
  Enter again:
# zfs list
  NAME          USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
  mypool        142K   984M    31K  /mypool
  mypool/BOOM    31K   984M    31K  /mypool/BOOM

# zpool get all mypool

mypool  feature@async_destroy  enabled                local
mypool  feature@encryption     active                 local

```
